Udacity project 2: Investigate Titanic Dataset - Python Programming Language

We analyzed Udacity's curated data including demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board of the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912, using NumPy and Pandas python modules. The dataset was obtained from the kaggle website.
